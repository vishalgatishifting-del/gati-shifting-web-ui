                        <h2>Factors Affecting the Cost of Pet Relocation in India</h2>
                        <p>The cost of house shifting depends on several things. Here are the main factors that affect the price:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Distance
                                Longer distances increase cost due to more travel time and logistics.

                            </li>
                            <li>Pet Type & Size
                                Larger pets or multiple animals require bigger carriers and extra care, raising the cost.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Travel Method
                                Air transport, ground transport, or a combination affects pricing. Enclosed or specialized carriers add to the cost.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Health & Documentation Needs
                                Vaccination certificates, permits, and veterinary checks may increase charges slightly.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Timing & Urgency
                                Peak seasons or urgent relocations can cost more than planned, scheduled moves.

                            </li>
                        </ol>
